                    that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness
                    of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and
                    easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our
                    being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
                    circumstances and owing
                    to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
                    repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
                    selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
                    pains."
