            "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized
            by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
            that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness
            of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and
            easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our
            being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
            circumstances and owing
            to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be
            repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
            selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
            pains."
